    			How the Web Works
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>The Web is a giant network of devices (<em>ex: laptops, PC's, servers, etc.</em>) that can talk to each other via an Internet connection from the device to an ISP. To connect from one device to another the Web uses HTTP (<em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em>) protocol to make this connection.</p>

				<h4><u>EXAMPLE:</u></h4>
				<p>When you type <a href="http://www.udacity.com">www.udacity.com</a> your computer sends HTTP protocol via the Internet connection to the Udacity web server. The Udacity web server then communicates back to your computer using HTTP to send the Udacity homepage.</p>

    			HTML
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>HTML or <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>is the coding language that is the base of any website.</p>

				<p>HTML is what shows the visual properties of a website. Whether it's plain text, images, or video, HTML is used to code these properties into the website. For a more detailed description view the following link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Wikipedia-HTML</a></p>

    			Tags and Elements
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>HTML code uses a structure of HTML <b>elements</b>. The different elements are what define the website you build.</p>
				<p>	A complete HTML element contains opening and ending <b>tags</b>. The HTML tag is what defines the type of element. Below is an image from our Udacity course that shows the structure of an element.

    			Inline or Block....What's the Difference?
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>HTML elements are considered either Inline or Block elements. Inline elements usually only displayed without line breaks, such as Underline or Bold elements. Block elements normally contain multiple lines of information. Everything within a block elements is contained in an invisible block. An example of a block element is <b>&lt;div&gt;</b>. This element is used in CSS styling, and when used everything within this tag would use the associated CSS associated styling for that <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> element.</p>

    			Tree Structure
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>HTML follows a tree like structure. The structure can start with a container element, such as <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> and within it can contain multiple other elements. There can be many levels of nested elements within one overall element.</p>

    			Keep Code Clean and Easy to Read
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>When creating HTML code it is very important to keep it clean and easy to read. The person writing the HTML code initially will likely not be the only person to ever read it again. For this reason, it is a good idea to indent nested elements and keep clear comments where needed.</p>

    			What is CSS?
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets". CSS is the coding language that determines how the HTML code is displayed and styled.</p>
				<p>In my own mind, I think of CSS as defining a CSS variable in HTML and then assigning that variable a set of CSS style attributes. Where ever that CSS "variable" is used within HTML, the corresponding elements and its contents use the CSS styling associated.</p>
				<p>The following link is a great summary and quick reference from Udacity on CSS. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3575138706/m-3611108698">CSS Summary and Reference</a></p>

    			Avoid Repetition in Styling
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>The major benefit of CSS is of not having to duplicate styling multiple times in HTML code. CSS allows for greater efficiency and saves a lot of time for programmers.</p>

				<p>CSS coding can be used three different ways.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>HTML code is linked to a separate CSS file, which is most common, especially for more complicated projects.</li>
						<li>Within a &lt;style&gt; element within the &lt;head&gt; element at top of HTML code. This method could be used for a smaller project.</li>
						<li>Write the styling code within the HTML code. This is least preferred method because it creates a lot of repetition and can lead to mistakes and headaches when debugging.</li>
